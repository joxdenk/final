    <hr>
    <p>I am a student of Bugema University studying a BSc. in Software Engineering. Technology is one of my deepest passionsâ€“ this had influenced me to found JI Innovations upon my high school graduation in 2018. My ideas at JI caught the attention of many people whom I met. They encouraged me a lot. <br>
        My career Aspirations are rooted in the technological industry, with current interest in innovation, entrepreneurship and other better services. My experience as an entrepreneur and founder of JI has greatly increased this aspirations and fuelled new curiosities in the corporate world of technology, public relations and innovation. I am looking for these opportunities throughout the duration of my studies and beyond. <br>
        Aside from my academic and career interests, I am extremely passionate and experienced in youth leadership. In 2019, I wrote an innovation project proposals to the ministry of education, South Sudan and the ministry is working on it and it will be implemented.</p>
